# N-Party Connect
> A Player Hub for Nintendo fans, made with C# .NET

This project was once a community for Nintendo fans, where users could create a profile to compete on local championships and win points and badges over a ranking. Also, users could interact with each other by adding their gaming accounts and even use widgets like Pok√©mon Friend Safari Finder.

The application went live on november, 2013, reaching over 2300 users in the first two weeks and appearing in lots of news as the "Brazilian Nintendo Social Network".

The development used the [Jetfuel Framework](http://eixox.github.io/guia-de-desenvolvimento/jetfuel.html) for an Aspect Orientation using annotations in every project entity for code reusability and easy alterability. Also, it uses Amazon's S3 for image hosting.
